# Srexec: source code execution backend #

This is a node module designed for execution simple and untrusted code.
It executes code in limited environments, running in linux with node.js.

The untrusted can read system files, but can write almost nothing.
Some extra limits can also be applied.

It could be used as a judge backend for ACM-ICPC-style contests.

## Development Status ##

Slowly developing, currently.
